### Udacity Nanodegree
Python project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

31st July 2023

### Description
Employing Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. It also takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
Python script: bikeshare.py file
The three city dataset files:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

which includes randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

7. Gender
8. Birth Year
